# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains various machine learning projects I've worked on. These projects include K-Means clustering, networking binary classification, and a comparison of a pre-trained model with one built from scratch. Each project is structured with clear steps, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and results analysis.

# Projects Overview
TASK-1 K-Means Clustering 
- Objective: To group data into clusters based on similarities without prior knowledge of the groups.
- Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib,Seaborn
- Key Features:
-   Implemented the K-Means algorithm from scratch.
-   Visualized clusters using Matplotlib.
-   Valuated performance using different clustering metrics like inertia and silhouette score.

TASK-3 Networking Binary Classification

- Objective: To classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn
- Key Features:
-   Preprocessed the data to handle missing values and categorical features.
-   Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
-   Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

TASK-2 Comparison of Pre-trained Model vs Model from Scratch

- Objective: To compare the performance of a pre-trained model with one built from scratch on a specific dataset.
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for the pre-trained model), Numpy ,Pandas,Seaborn,Sklearn models
- Key Features:
-   Trained a machine learning model from scratch using a logistics Regression algorithm.
-   Compared the results with a pre-trained model using metrics like accuracy and training time.
-   Detailed analysis of why one model outperforms the other.
